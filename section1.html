        The English Premier League (EPL) was founded in 1991.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the 1990s, English First Division(football league before EPL) clubs believed that in order
        for football in England to develop and flourish, they would need
        to reconstruct the entire league.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1992, 22 teams resigned from the First Division league to sign with
        the newly crafted Premier League
        <br>
        <br>
        The league began and struck their first television deal with sky sports,
        who helped develop the league into what it is today.
